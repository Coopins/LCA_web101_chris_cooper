<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Every choice you make is creating your future. Choose wisely"</p><cite>Unknown Author</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"We do not choose to be born. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our historical epoch, the country of our birth, or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing...but within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live."</p><cite>Joseph Epstein</cite></blockquote>

<p>Every choice we make creates a new path which then diverges infinitely into the future.</p>

<p>With each new choice, we create a new path, never before explored and never to exist again once we embark upon it. Like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" story, no matter how "everyday" life may seem, no choice or path is exactly the same nor is any event, situation, circumstance, issue or solution.</p>

<p>A fine example is the following poem "The Fig Tree" by Sylvia Plath (Illustration by <a href="https://zenpencils.com/about/">Gavin Aung Than</a>, amazing cartoonist and owner of <a href="http://Zenpencils.com">Zenpecils.com</a></p>

<p>If you took the time to read and enjoy the above illustration, you can figure out two things: 1. Time waits for no one, 2. with time waiting for no one, it's best that we make a choice, any choice, so long as it's beneficial to us and perhaps others. Otherwise, we find that life has passed us by and the options/choices we once had are gone. Beginning, starting, choosing, allows for the opening of doors we never thought possible. </p>

<p>Time is unforgiving. It cares not who you are, what you own, what power you may or may not have. It marches on, as is its job. It cannot be saved. It must be spent, and you, dear reader, must choose how to spend it. </p>

<p>So where does the idea of the "Ultimate Multiverse You" come in?</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with what the multiverse is, it's "the hypothetical set of multiple possible universes that comprise all of reality." </p>

<p>Hypothetical? Yes. Highly possible in an ever expanding universe? You bet your sweet ass! </p>

<p>What this all comes down to is that there may VERY well be an "Ultimate Multiverse You."</p>

<p>A version or versions of yourself that is extremely close to or are already living the life you truly desire. They're either achieving or have already achieved the goals and dreams you've always dreamed about. They're becoming or have already become the person you've always wanted to be. </p>

<p>They are the ultimate version(s) of you.</p>

<p>In a conversation I had with a buddy of mine I shared my thoughts about the multiverse/infinite universes. </p>

<p>I mentioned "how there's perhaps an infinite number of universes and how by using our imaginations we can imagine what the other versions of ourselves are doing and what kind of lives they're living. We can even use them for inspiration!"</p>

<p>I then told him that "I thought about the version of myself that's out there either doing or close to doing all the things I want to do myself."</p>

<p>"I began thinking about the ways he most likely got to where he is. His thoughts, actions, and lifestyle.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on me that there's things I'll have to change in order to get where he is.</p>

<p>I must follow his example(s) and/or what I believe his example(s) would be.</p>

<p>He is my ultimate multiverse version. Of whom I truly desire to be. </p>


<p>There's a quote that goes "Someone once told me the definition of Hell: On your last day on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become."</p>


<p>Will you make the ultimate multiverse version of yourself proud? Or will you remain the same? </p>

<p>The choice will always be yours. </p>
